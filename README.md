# The US Accidents Analysis Project

This project utilizes a comprehensive dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents) to delve into and derive insights from traffic accidents that occur across the United States. The dataset provides detailed information about these accidents, including their location, severity, weather conditions, and time of occurrence.

Letâ€™s delve into the insights derived from the exploratory analysis of the US Accidents dataset:
1. No data for new york.
2. The number of accidents per city decreases exponentially.
3. Less then 4% of cities have more than 1000 yearly accidents.
4. over 1200 cities have reported only one accident (need to investigate).
